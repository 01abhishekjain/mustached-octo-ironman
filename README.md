This is only for Android. All this plugin does is show the native media volume dialog box.

To add the plugin to your cordova project:

cordova plugin add https://github.com/01abhishekjain/mustached-octo-ironman

Run the following once the device ready event is fired:

cordova.plugins.MediaVolumePlugin.show();
