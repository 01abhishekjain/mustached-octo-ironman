Media Volume Plugin

This is only for Android. All this plugin does is show the native media volume dialog box.

To add the plugin to your cordova project:
cordova plugin add https://github.com/01abhishekjain/mustached-octo-ironman

Run the following once the device ready event is fired:
cordova.plugins.MediaVolumePlugin.show();

That's it!
